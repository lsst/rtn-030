\section{System description} \label{sec:desc}

\VRO produces around 20TB of astronomical data per night for the 10 year \gls{LSST}
Data are processed in \gls{SLAC}, \gls{IN2P3} and ROE.
A publicly available alert stream emanates from the \gls{USDF} at \gls{SLAC}.
Processing is the responsibility's of \gls{RDP} department while Quality Assurance is carried out under \gls{RPF} department.

The Rubin \gls{Operations} Plan \citeds{RDO-018} gives more details.
The USDF specification is in \citeds{DMTN-189} but some architecture details are provided in \secref{sec:arc}.



\subsection{Data verification and quality assurance }
Members of the \gls{RPF} department assess the data quality at short and long timescales.
They require access to tools installed at the summit as well as in the data facilities.
In particular they will need access to images as they are processed to generate alerts.

These team members will have to have \gls{SLAC} accounts to perform this work - \gls{SLAC} accounts are governed by (need doc).\action{RD}{Mar 2022}{Handle for doc covering users accounts at \gls{SLAC}}.
In addition they will need summit accounts as governed by \citeds{ittn-045} and \citeds{ittn-010}.



\subsection{Data processing}
\subsubsection{Data Release Processing}
DRP is performed only on unencumbered data which is fully available to Rubin Data Access rights holders.
Processing is carried out at three sites.
Each site has its own security policies (need doc refs) \action{RD,GS,FH}{Mar 2022}{Handle for security docs \gls{US},Fr,UK DFs}


\subsection{Data access}
After a short period of encumbrance image and derived data are made available to all
data rights holders as defined in \citeds{LDO-13}.

Front end data access via the \gls{RSP} will be hosted on a cloud provider such as Google.
Thus not requiring community science users to have SLAC accounts.
