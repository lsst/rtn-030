\section{Introduction}
This is the Rubin \gls{DP} information and data security plan for operations.
This renders \citeds{LDM-324} obsolete.

This security plan conforms with the construction era security documentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item “LSST Information Classification Policy” \citedsp{LPM-122}
\item “LSST Master Information Security Policy” \citedsp{LPM-121}
\end{itemize}

During the ramp up to operations further security requirements were given to the project by the agencies.
The response to these is in \gls{DMTN}-199\footnote{This is a limited availability document}.

The \gls{DP} department is concerned with the operations and maintenance  of Rubin constructed software, hardware and networks.
Development remains open-source in nature.

Data from the telescope on Cerro Pach\'{o}n is transmitted over Rubin controlled networks to \gls{SLAC} in  Menlo Park USA.
After an agreed embargo period all data will be transmitted to the \gls{IN2P3} in Lyon, France, and at least some data is transmitted to the Royal Observatory Edinburgh.
Processing occurs in all three locations using a coordinate release of the Rubin \gls{Science Pipelines}.

Access to data will be provided to authorized via a US \gls{DAC}
A data access center similar to the \gls{US} \gls{DAC} will also be provided in Chile.

For data taken initially we have been requested to comply with \citeds{NIST.SP.800-171} the compliance matrix is provided in \appref{ap:compliance}
