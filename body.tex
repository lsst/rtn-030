\section{Introduction}
This is the Rubin information and data security plan for operations.
This renders \citeds{LDM-324} obsolete.

This security plan conforms with the construction era security documentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item “LSST Information Classification Policy” \citedsp{LPM-122}
\item “LSST Master Information Security Policy” \citedsp{LPM-121}
\end{itemize}

Note has been taken of \cite{TCISSG}.

During the ramp up to operations further security requirements were given to the project by the agencies.
The response to these is in \gls{DMTN}-199.

The \gls{RDM} department is concerned with the operations and maintenance  of Rubin constructed software, hardware and networks.
Development remains open-source in nature.

Data from the telescope on Cerro Pach\'{o}n is transmitted over Rubin controlled networks to \gls{SLAC} in  Menlo Park USA.
After an agreed embargo period all raw data will be transmitted to the French Data Facility at the computing center for \gls{IN2P3} in Lyon, France, and at least some raw data is transmitted to the United Kingdom Data Facility operating on the IRIS infrastructure and in particular utilizing facilities at \gls{RAL} and Lancaster University.
Processing occurs in all locations using a coordinated release of the Rubin \gls{Science Pipelines}.

Access to data will be provided to authorized  users via a US \gls{DAC}.
A data access center similar to the \gls{US} \gls{DAC} will also be provided in Chile.

For data taken initially we have been requested to comply with \citeds{NIST.SP.800-171}; the compliance matrix is provided in  \citeds{RTN-082}.
SLAC is subject to \citeds{nist800-53}


This document does not do a detailed threat analysis though this should be and is done for individual systems and \gls{Enclave}s. \cite{TCISSG} is a good guide for software threats.
