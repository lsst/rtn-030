\section{Cyber incident response}
In this document many threat vectors are identified.
Rubin and SLAC  IT, Chile DevOps Team and many other \gls{DM} staff are highly aware of these threat vectors.
If an incident is observed we:
\begin{itemize}
\item Notify the \gls{ISO} \citedsp{LPM-121}
\item \gls{ISO} coordinates the security team analysis to determine the scope of the incident and establish it is a real threat
\item \gls{ISO} notifies \gls{PMO} (project manager and deputies )
\item The \gls{ISO} decides which information and  how widely to broadcast to all staff.
\item Investigation and remediation are initiated - which may include disaster recovery.
\item The combined Rubin \gls{IT} team (SLAC, and AURA)  take action to isolate, remove or  switch off affected systems.
\item Staff are informed of the plan to return systems to service.
\item \gls{ISO} organizes a Post Incident Review
\end{itemize}
