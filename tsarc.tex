\section{Telescope and Site  System architecture} \label{sec:tsarc}

 We concern our selves here mainly with the software architecture of telescope and site,
this includes the control system but also the controlled devices and various test stands.

The control system architecture is given in \citeds{LSE-150}.
Broadly this is a message bus architecture with  various controllable components such as the Camera, Environmental Control, etc. attached to it.
The components can receive control messages and telemetry from the bus by listening to various queues.
The script queue component allows for orchestrated commanding of various components.

This set may be seen for the Main Telescope as well as the Auxiliary Telescope.
In addition there is a test stand in the Base and one in Tucson which have physical DAQ hardware to emulate the camera and can simulate many other physical components for testing the control system.

We consider these systems under the same headings used in \secref{sec:dparc}.
